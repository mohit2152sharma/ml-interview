# pandas

1. How do you check which version of `pandas` you have installed?

  a) The python packages have a `__version__` attribute which we can use to see their version. If we are in python interpretor, I can do the following:

  ```python
  import pandas
  print(pandas.__version__)
  ```
  Or if I am in terminal and have `pip` installed, I can run the command `pip show pandas` and it will show me the `pandas` version and other related information about it.
